# Regression-for-a-Bike-Sharing-DataSet

A model is developed to estimate the count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered. Data cleaning, features engineering, model building, evaluating and tunning are done on the data. Linear, Lasso, Polynomial, and Random Forest Regressors are considered and also GridsearchCV is used to reach the best model. 

Data Set Information:

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

Data cleaning :

The raw data from UCI was not prepared, so I have cleaned the data. In order to clean and prepare the data, first I checked if there was missing values.
Four variables had missing values. For WeatherSituation which is a categorical variable, I replaced the missing values with the value that was repeated the most.
For the Humidity variable which is a continuous variable, I replaced the NaN values with the mean of the other observations.
For Casual and Registered variables since they make the target variable, I decided to remove the observations with missing values.
In the rest of the data cleaning and preparing process, I also changed the name of the variables, defined new variable, and change the type of variables which their types were not correct.

EDA :

In the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) part, I used histograms, bar charts, box charts and scatter plots to investigate the variables and their relation through visualization.
I have also used statistical methods such as correlation and ANOVA to check the relation between the target variable (TotalBikes) and other variables.
